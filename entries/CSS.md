##  Cascading style sheets 
- Cascading style sheets (css) is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a document written in a markup language such as html or xml (including xml dialects such as svg, mathml or xhtml).[1] css is a cornerstone technology of the world wide web, alongside html and javascript.[2]

- Css is designed to enable the separation of content and presentation, including layout, colors, and fonts.[3] this separation can improve content accessibility; provide more flexibility and control in the specification of presentation characteristics; enable multiple web pages to share formatting by specifying the relevant css in a separate .css file, which reduces complexity and repetition in the structural content; and enable the .css file to be cached to improve the page load speed between the pages that share the file and its formatting.

- Separation of formatting and content also makes it feasible to present the same markup page in different styles for different rendering methods, such as on-screen, in print, by voice (via speech-based browser or screen reader), and on braille-based tactile devices. css also has rules for alternate formatting if the content is accessed on a mobile device.[4]

- The name cascading comes from the specified priority scheme to determine which style rule applies if more than one rule matches a particular element. this cascading priority scheme is predictable.

- The css specifications are maintained by the world wide web consortium (w3c). internet media type (mime type) text/css is registered for use with css by rfc 2318 (march 1998). the w3c operates a free css validation service for css documents.[5]

- In addition to html, other markup languages support the use of css including xhtml, plain xml, svg, and xul. css is also used in the gtk widget toolkit.
