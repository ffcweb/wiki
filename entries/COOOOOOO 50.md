# New Page: Clicking “Create New Page” in the sidebar should take the user to a page where they can create a new encyclopedia entry.

- Users should be able to enter a title for the page and, in a textarea, should be able to enter the Markdown content for the page.

- Users should be able to click a button to save their new page.

- When the page is saved, if an encyclopedia entry already exists with the provided title, the user should be presented with an error message.

- Otherwise, the encyclopedia entry should be saved to disk, and the user should be taken to the new entry’s page.
